  Donovan and Dawn Isaacs are the proud owners of Lomax Window & Door Co.
  Donovan started building windows in the early 90’s in Saint Cloud, MN. Being
  from the Midwest has given Donovan a strong work ethic and the ability to
  build like none other (it’s too cold to do it a second time, so get it done
  right the first time around)! He moved to Colorado in 1999. Through the years,
  he has moved up the window ladder, and his knowledge of the industry is
  incredible! The opportunity to own and operate Lomax was too good to pass up!
  With Dawn on board to run the office, they figured it would be a great family
  opportunity.  Donovan and Dawn are local Fort Collins residents. They live
  near Horsetooth Reservoir with their three sons and many, many, fuzzy and
  feathered friends. The Lomax Window and Door Co. team is comprised of family
  and employees who are known and trusted to get the job done!  “We want our
  customers to be part of our team as well and to help us continue to grow as a
  quality Colorado company!”  -Donovan & Dawn Isaacs

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

      The first time I tried Kaldi’s coffee, I couldn’t even believe that was
      the same thing I’ve been drinking every morning.
